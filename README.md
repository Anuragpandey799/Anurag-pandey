### About Me

Hi! I’m Anurag Pandey, a passionate Frontend Developer, MERN Enthusiast, and UI/UX Designer based in India. I love building visually stunning, interactive, and high-performance web applications that provide meaningful user experiences.

I specialize in crafting modern, responsive, and animation-rich web interfaces using React, Tailwind CSS, and creative design principles. My portfolio reflects my journey as a self-driven developer who believes in clean code, thoughtful UI, and real-world usability.

Through my projects, I aim to bridge the gap between design and development, ensuring that every product I build is not just functional — but delightful to use.
